# ESP-Middleman

#### Still in production but the code base can be used with almost any controller with proper platformio.ini configurations!
#### And the login portal files can be also modified to user needs

## Introduction

ESP-Middleman is a practical project designed to create a middle-man Access Point (AP) for various purposes. It provides a flexible login portal configuration, allowing users to mimic login portals of popular Wi-Fi networks and capture login credentials for analysis or testing purposes.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Login Portal**: Configure the login portal to resemble any website, catering to your specific needs or target audience.
- **Simulated Wi-Fi Network**: Mimics the login portal of the most populated Wi-Fi networks nearby, making it appear authentic to users.
- **Credential Capture**: Captures the login credentials entered by users, providing valuable insights or testing data.

## Getting Started

To get started with ESP-Middleman, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary hardware components, including the ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller.
2. **Software Installation**: Install the required software libraries and dependencies on your microcontroller.
3. **Configuration**: Customize the login portal according to your requirements and configure the Wi-Fi network settings.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the ESP-Middleman in the desired location, ensuring it is within range of target Wi-Fi networks.
5. **Data Collection**: Monitor the captured login credentials through the provided interface or logging mechanism.

## Usage

Once deployed, ESP-Middleman operates silently, intercepting and logging login credentials from unsuspecting users. Remember to adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations when using this tool.
